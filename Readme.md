# Software that I use on a daily basis

With inspiration from [awesome-uses](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses "awesome-uses on GitHub"), this page lists software and hardware I use on a daily basis.

### Software

* [Debian](https://debian.org/ "Debian") is currently my Linux distribution of choice.
    *   After years with [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/ "Arch Linux") I switched back to [Debian](https://debian.org/ "Debian").
*   [i3](https://i3wm.org/ "i3") window manager or [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/ "Gnome")
    *   I switch between the i3 window manager and the Gnome desktop according to my mood.
*   [vim](https://www.vim.org/ "vim") or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (I paid for Ultimate)
    *   I paid for the Ultimate license to code in Java, Go, and PHP.
*   [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/de/firefox/new/ "Firefox")
    *   Browsing the web.
*   [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/ "Bitwarden")
    *   Knows all my passwords and some other information.
*   [Slack](https://slack.com "Slack")
    *   Communication with my teammates.

### Hardware

    *   My primary smartphone. Always silent.
*   [Apple Watch 4](https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-4/ "Apple Watch 4")
    *   I always wear it. If you call me, it vibrates because my phone is always silent. But before calling me, ask yourself … Is it textable?

    *   I use the AirPods when I’m running or do powerlifting.

    *   Makes a good job :)
*   27” external monitor
    *   Just a second monitor.
